# Ketcher for VS Code

**Ketcher for VS Code** allows you to design and edit chemical structures directly within your favorite code editor. It integrates the robust [Ketcher](https://lifescience.opensource.epam.com/ketcher/) web-based molecularer editor into Visual Studio Code.

## Features

- **Embedded Editor**: Opens `*.ketcher.svg` files in a fully functional local instance of Ketcher.
- **Polyglot SVGs**: Files are saved as standard SVGs that render in any browser or image viewer.
    - Chemical structure data (KetJSON) is embedded invisibly within the SVG metadata, allowing you to re-open and edit the structure at any time without data loss.
- **Native Integration**:
    - Uses standard VS Code **Save** (`Cmd+S` / `Ctrl+S`) and **Open** commands.
    - Supports standard file operations (Rename, Delete, Move) within the Explorer.
    - Offline capable (bundles the editor locally).

## Usage

1.  **Create a File**: Create a new file with the extension `.ketcher.svg` (e.g., `reaction.ketcher.svg`).
2.  **Edit**: Click the file to open the Ketcher interface. Use the toolbar to draw molecules, reactions, and mechanisms.
3.  **Save**: Press `Cmd+S` (macOS) or `Ctrl+S` (Windows/Linux). The extension will generate the SVG representation and save it to disk.
4.  **View**: Open the file in any web browser or SVG viewer to see your drawing.
